# No Show Appointment

A patient schedules a doctor's appointment, does all the necessary steps, and then cancels. Who is at fault?

An appointment dataset from public hospitals in Vitoria, Brazil is examined in this study. My attention is drawn to the cause of the patient's absence. This dataset includes data on patient characteristics, appointment information, and whether patients skip appointments. The data set is accessible through Kaggle.
I want to provide some answers on the causes of patients missing appointments through this initiative.
